<h2>What is poker?</h2>
<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/">Webster's Dictionary</a> defines poker as "any of several card games in which a player bets that the value of his or her hand is greater than that of the hands held by others, in which each subsequent player must either equal or raise the bet or drop out, and in which the player holding the highest hand at the end of the betting wins the pot."
