<h1>Variations</h1>

<div class="section">
In “stud” games, players are dealt a number of cards (typically 5 or 7) and must use those original cards to make their best hand.

In “draw” games, the players may decide to trade in some of their cards (generally up to 3) in an effort to improve their hand.

In “community card” games, the players are dealt “hole cards” face down (cards that are uniquely theirs) then play off the community cards to make their best hand. What makes them “community cards?” The other players at the table also may play off them.
</div><div class="section">
<strong>Texas Hold ‘Em</strong>

Played in the World Series of Poker, Texas Hold ‘Em is easily the most popular poker game in America today. In Texas Hold ‘Em, players are dealt two “pocket” or “hole cards” then wait for 5 community cards to be revealed.

Betting takes place in four rounds: once after the hole cards are dealt, once after the first three community cards are revealed (referred to as “the flop”), once after the fourth community card is revealed (“the turn”) and lastly after the fifth community card is flipped (“the river”). Players must make their best hands with any combination of 5 cards (their hole cards and the communal).

<strong>Omaha</strong>

Omaha is another type of Hold ‘Em that can be played by 2-10 players at a time. Like Texas Hold ‘Em, there are four rounds of betting, but unlike that version, each player is dealt four hole cards and the five community cards are immediately revealed. Players must make their best 5-card hands from two of their hole cards and three of the common.
</div><div class="section">
<strong>7-Card Stud</strong>

In 7-Card Stud, each player is dealt 7 cards, three down and four up. Players must make best possible 5-card hand from their 7.
</div><div class="section">
<strong>5-Card Draw</strong>

Each player is dealt 5 cards, but on the initial go around, the player may choose to trade in up to 3 of them.
</div><div class="section">
<strong>High / Low Chicago</strong>

This stud game can be played for the highest hand or the lowest. In High Chicago, the player with the highest spade face-down wins half the pot. In Low Chicago, the player with the lowest spade face-down wins half the pot.

The other half of the pot is won by the player with the best hand. If someone, however, has the best hand and the winning spade (high or low, depending on version), that player will win the entire pot.

This game can be added to, and played simultaneously with, many other poker variations.
